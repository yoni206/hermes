   \brief Main entry point for linear arithmetics reasoning

   \details The implementation is based on the Simplex and follows the Technical
   Report SRI-CSL-06-01 by Bruno Dutertre and Leonardo de Moura.

   The module is backtracking and uses the global "undo" stack to synchronize
   its state with that of the rest of the reasoning engine.

   A typical usage scenario for this module is the following

   - LA_xx_init

   - One or several calls to LA_xx_notify_formula

   - A single call to LA_xx_simp realizes some simplifications that cannot be
   later backtracked.

   - One or several calls to LA_xx_assert, LA_xx_assert_eq, LA_xx_assert_neq

   - LA_xx_solve

   - Optionally, LA_xx_solve_z

   - LA_xx_conflict if the current set of constraints is unsatisfiable.

   - LA_xx_repair must be called to bring the module to a safe state, before
   asserting new constraints, and after a resolution step has led to
   unsatisfiability, and conflicting constraints have been removed.

   - LA_xx_model_eq if the current set of constraints is satisfiable.

   - LA_xx_done.
